I prefer using splitting before Feature Scaling so that there is no loss of data as in Feature Scaling we can loose some data. So, in the following codes splitting is done before feature scaling. 

The other question which some of the people can ask is what method should be used for Feature Scaling whether Normalisation or Standardisation. I will mostly use Standardisation. Normalization works well only when we have some specific type of data but Standardization always works well. For better understanding, you can try both and check the results.
