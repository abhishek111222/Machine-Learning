Multiple Linear Regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more features and a response by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The steps to perform multiple linear Regression are almost similar to that of simple linear Regression. The Difference Lies in the evaluation. We can use it to find out which factor has the highest impact on the predicted output and now different variable relate to each other.

Here : Y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + b3 * x3 + …… bn * xn Y = Dependent variable and x1, x2, x3, …… xn = multiple independent variables

Assumption of Regression Model :
    1. Linearity: The relationship between dependent and independent variables should be linear.
    2. Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of the errors should be maintained.
    3. Multivariate normality: Multiple Regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed.
    4. Lack of Multicollinearity: It is assumed that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data.

We should never use Multiple Linear Regression to predict a dependent variable that is growing exponentially with time.
